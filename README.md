AI model for predicting heavy metal concentration in fish using machine learning.

### Problem Statement
Heavy metal contamination (Mercury, Lead, Arsenic, and Cadmium) poses a significant health risk through seafood consumption. Public datasets on seafood contamination often cover a limited range of species and regions, which can lead to misinformation and unnecessary avoidance of seafood altogether. The truth is only a certain amount of species show consistent elevated contamination levels, while many remain safe and nutritionally valuable. This project aims to develop an AI model that predicts heavy metal concentrations in fish based on factors such as species, size, location, and diet. The model will also be capable of estimating safe consumption limits for different species of fish. With the combination of seafood contamination datasets and machine learning, this project seeks to promote both awareness and balanced dietary choices.

### Proposal Method
1. *Gathering Data and Cleaning:* Locating datasets is the first priority as it is the backbone of the project. I will need a few different sources for reliable testing and multiple different types of heavy metal sources.
2. *Planning Model:* Mapping out the model to make sure I include all the necessary functions are fundamental for making sure this project succeeds. Trying to implement different functions later in the project could lead to problems and inefficient time usage. Having all the functions pre-decided will lead to a more efficient project design.
3. *Model Development:* Once all functions are decided, I can now implement data and build functions for my project. Training the model will take some time as I will have to make many adjustments so the model is as optimal as possible. I will have to use classification models so that it is more efficient.
4. *Evaluation & Testing:* Once the model is built, I will have to test many different possible inputs and outputs so that my model is as perfect and accurate as intended. I hope that there will be minimal adjustments but I will go as far as needed to have the best set of outouts possible.
5. *Interface:* Once the model is complete, I will need a presentable interface that will allow users to interact with my model in a friendly manner. I hope that it will be used in practical and useful environments and will provide helpful information to those in need.
