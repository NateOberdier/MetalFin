# MetalFin
AI model for predicting heavy metals in fish across all bodies of water using machine learning.

# Proposal
Heavy metal contamination (Mercury, Lead, Arsenic, and Cadmium) poses a significant health risk through seafood consumption. Public datasets on seafood contamination often cover a limited range of species and regions, which can lead to misinformation and unnecessary avoidance of seafood altogether. The truth is only a certain amount of species show consistent elevated contamination levels, while many remain safe and nutritionally valuable. This project aims to develop an AI model that predicts heavy metal concentrations in fish based on factors such as species, size, location, and diet. The model will also be capable of estimating safe consumption limits for different species of fish. With the combination of seafood contamination datasets and machine learning, this project seeks to promote both awareness and balanced dietary choices.
